# This script provides a wrapper around make that sets some important
# variables based on a couple of inputs:
#
# PATH                          should include the LLVM/Clang you want to use
#                               and (optionally) the 'tesla' script
#
# TESLA            [optional]   if the 'tesla' script isn't on the PATH,
#                               this variable should point to it
#
# TESLA_BUILD_DIR  [optional]   if TELSA hasn't been installed to the PATH,
#                               this is where its build outputs can be found
#                               (used by 'tesla' script)
