TESLA: Temporally Enforced Security Logic Assertions
====================================================================

TESLA is a tool that allow programmers to add temporal assertions to
their security-critical code. Rather than simply asserting that
"a particular expression evaluates to true right now", programmers
can specify temporal properties such as "this access control check
occurs before that object is used".
