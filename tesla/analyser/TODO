Things left to do:

 * more function-related events:
   * caller/callee versions of everything
   * entry with params (which could be "ANY")
   * return with retval (which could be "ANY")

 * actually extract the information that we need for:
   * instrumentation
   * pattern matching
   * automata

 * investigate using Clang's new ASTMatcher framework
