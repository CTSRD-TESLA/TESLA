TODOs for Jon's Clang instrumentation:
- deal with calls within expressions to pass to instrumentation
  - we don't want to do '__instrument_return(foo()); return foo();'
- instrument malloc() and equivalents
  - dep: instrument assignments to variables of specified type
- instrument assignments to named global variables
- generate __tesla_data programmatically (no real declaration required)
  - I'm no longer convinced that we actually want to do this; need to declare
    it for event handlers anyway...
