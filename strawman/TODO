TODOs for Jon's Clang instrumentation:
- instrument malloc() and equivalents
  - dep: instrument assignments to variables of specified type
- instrument assignments to named global variables
- handle non-compound => compound conversion
  - e.g. 'if (err) return err;' => 'if (err) { __instrument(); return err; }'
- generate __tesla_data programmatically (no real declaration required)
  - I'm no longer convinced that we actually want to do this; need to declare
    it for event handlers anyway...
