TODO's for Robert's libtesla:

- Replace the linear time array of automata state with something more
  efficient.  Ideally something that can scale to 1000+ entries.
- Add some sort of sanity check on the 'limit' argument.  Possibly TESLA
  should round up to the nearest prime.
- Implement some sort of more granular locking scheme for global state.
- Implement kernel global state.
- Implement kernel per-thread state.
- Investigate using stack(9) somehow to capture stack traces.
- Provide statistics for various failure modes, especially exhaustion of
  automata storage.
