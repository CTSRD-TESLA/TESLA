Things people are going to look at:
* rwatson
  * socket lock verification
* kg365
  * MAC framework ( + audit?)
  * OpenSSH (sshd)
* theraven
  * Python Objective-C bindings ("spectacularly shoddy code")
  * cross-language assertions (e.g. Smalltalk) -> requires dynamic registration
  * Xlib/Xcb: some X state-machine checking already
* marinosi
  * marinosi's stack
* avsm2
  * OCaml GC (C interface)
* bz
  * possibly ND6 or IPSEC assertions?
* jon
  * check ability to express BigKnife's state machines
  * will ponder Capsicum
* brooks
  * dhclient
  * will ponder Capsicum


Other possible targets:
* OpenSSL
  * how many ports do it wrongly?
* Kerberos
* Kernel TCP?
* John Baldwin's thread, process state machines
* Xen? (split drivers, etc.)
* PAM ("complex, annoying, stateful")?
* NFSv4?
  * nfslockd
* PPP
  * lots of handcrafted switch cases
* named, libresolve
